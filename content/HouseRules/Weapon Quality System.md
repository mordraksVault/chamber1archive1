title: Weapon Quality System
draft: false
---

There are four additional tiers of quality that can be applied to any non-magical weapon to provide subtle but significant mechanical differences:

- Reinforced
- Reliable
- (Standard)
- Faulty
- Ruined

Standard serves as the baseline for cost and damage adjustments, representing the standard DnD 5e traits for a given weapon.

# Weapon Quality Table

| Quality    | Cost Adj. | Damage Adj.       |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Reinforced | x4        | +1d, take highest |
| Reliable   | x2        | x1                |
| Standard   | x1        | x1                |
| Faulty     | x0.25     | +1d, take lowest  |
| Ruined     | x0        | STR/DEX mod       |

# Upgrading Quality

Weapon quality can be upgraded by blacksmiths. Any blacksmith can upgrade a ruined or faulty weapon as high as standard quality. To upgrade to the status of reliable a blacksmith workshop of a Journeyman is required, for the upgrade to reinforced quality you need to find a Master blacksmith. Journeyman and Master Blacksmiths are members of the Blacksmith Guild and can usually be found in large towns and cities. 

## Cost

The gold cost is equal to the difference in cost between the desired quality and the current quality of the weapon

## Time

The number of days required is equal to the cost divided by ten but limited to 3 Months

# Downgrading Quality

At the DM's discretion, weapon quality may be downgraded in combat or under extreme conditions.

## In Combat

In combat a weapon's quality can be downgraded when a character is subjected to a critical hit of damage type bludgeoning or slashing while wielding the weapon. In this case the character chooses to either take the critical hit as usual or use their reaction to sacrifice their weapon, downgrading its quality and reducing the critical hit to a normal hit. Weapons of reinforced or reliable quality can absorb multiple critical hits before their quality is downgraded. 
- Reinforced: absorb 3 critical hits before downgrading to reliable quality
- Reliable: absorb 2 critical hots before downgrading to standard quality
- Standard: absorb 1 critical hit before downgrading to standard quality
- Faulty: can not absorb critical hits
- Ruined: can not absorb critical hits

## Extreme conditions

Weapon quality may be downgraded by extreme environmental conditions or magical effects including but not limited to fire, lightning, lava, extreme heat and cold, long periods underwater, or very long periods of time.
