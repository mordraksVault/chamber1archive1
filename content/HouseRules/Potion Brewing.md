The collecting of ingredients and brewing of potions requires specialised equipment and knowledge.

# Harvesting Ingredients

To be able to harvest plants and use them as ingredients in potions, at least one of the players needs to carry a Herbalism Kit. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. 
During long or short rests, you can search for plants nearby. Make a survival check vs the DC of the plant.
Ingredients can also be harvested from certain monsters. A character can attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Nature check. Proficiency with the poisoner’s kit applies to this check if the character doesn’t have proficiency in Nature. On a successful check, the character harvests a single dose of poison. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature’s poison.

Ingredients can sometimes be bought from apothecaries, herbalists , alchemists or travelling merchants. They can also be sold.

# Recipes

Potions are not easy to make. Besides skill they also require time and first and foremost a recipe. At least one character needs to be in possession of the recipe for the potion you want to brew. The recipe states the exact ingredients, time and difficulty the potion requires to be brewed successfully. 

# Brewing Potions

To brew a potion, you must have the required ingredients and time as stated by the recipe. Potions can only be brewed with the correct equipment which usually can be found in towns in an alchemist, potion or herbalist shop as well as in apothecaries. Since the brewing equipment is very valuable it is common practice to pay a small fee to be able to use the equipment.

A Medicine Check vs the DC stated by the recipe must be successful in order for the potion to be of sufficient quality. If the check fails, the Potion cannot be used. The required time for brewing the potion will pass in either case.
