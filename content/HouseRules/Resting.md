title: Resting

While adventuring out in the woods, deep in a dungeon surrounded by skeletons or just traveling on the road and sleeping outside, getting enough rest can be hard to come by. The basic rules of Resting from the PHB mostly apply but a weakened form of the play style *gritty realism* from the DMG are used as well as some house rules. 

- Short Rest: In unsafe environments such as a dungeon, a cave or on the side of the road.
- Long Rest: In safe environment such as an Inn, a friends house or maybe even a camp.

Safe environments are specified by the DM.

# Short Rest

If the characters are resting in an unsafe environment, these modified rules for the short rest apply:

A short rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity — at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity — the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

## Hit Points

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

## Spell Slots

For each of a characters spell casting levels, he or she regains up to half of the total spell slots for that level (rounded down).


# Long Rest

If the characters are resting in a safe environment, the normal rules for a long rest apply:

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity — at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity — the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice , up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
